## Overview
![test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yohemm/RPG/master/asset/animation/sprites/player/idle/0.png)
A 2D rpg video game with quest, there are no aim, just discover the wolrd.

The game was created for end of my high school to learn python and pygame.

At the end of the project, the map was 2 time bigger, and the quest were more complex.

But I lost the last version of the project, and I don't remember all the code.

The project have MapCreator like paint. And a beautiful menu system with lot of animation.

All of assets were made by me.
